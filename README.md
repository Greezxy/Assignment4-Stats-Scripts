# Assignment 4 – Statistics in Python

This assignment is based on the **“Statistics in Python”** tutorial by **Gaël Varoquaux**, part of the [Scipy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/packages/statistics/index.html).

The goal of this assignment is to explore basic statistical analysis and data visualization techniques in Python using packages such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `statsmodels`.

## Contents

- `notebooks/stats_python.ipynb`: Annotated Jupyter Notebook following the tutorial with examples, plots, and commentary.
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment file specifying dependencies.
- `requirements.txt`: (Optional) pip-based environment export.
- `.gitignore`: Lists files and folders excluded from Git tracking.

## Requirements

This project assumes a standard scientific Python environment including:

- Python 3.10
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- jupyterlab

If using Conda, you can install the environment with:

bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate stats-env
jupyter lab
